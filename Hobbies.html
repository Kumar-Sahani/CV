        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p class= "p">Being good at sport or at least being an average at it is an essential part of life. During the days when I was at the lowest point in my life, sports helped me overcome them. During my 4th grade, I was indulged into the cricket couching, which is what gave me an idea, which then I carried away in the future and kept trying to learn other sports like Basketball and sprinting.</p>

      <h3>Designing</h3>
      <p>I started designing things as an escape from the childhood trauma, but it eventually helped me realise my creativity. Right now, I design protypes of my own ideas like Artificial Muscles, One-Wheel devices, ILE(a device that would help to pilot the entire planet)and sometimes Artistic related stuff.</p>

      <img class="skt" src="images/writing.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="writing-skill">

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>Reading and Writing are the practices in my life which helps us break to the limits of our consious mind. I started reading horror novels also known as JEE entrance books, soon I realised it wasn't my type of genre. So I shifted to Si-Fi, they amazed and in no time I started writing my own stuff.</p>

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>We don't learn how to swim by reading books, the best way is to know as minimum as possible and throw ourselves into the vast ocean and go against its current. Programming helped me unlock the limits and expand the my thinking process while solving any type of problems. After starting my programming journey, I tend to find a better solution in more efficient way.</p>

        <h3>Sketching</h3>
        <p>The ability to express emotions without vocally expressing them, is the one of best gifts humanity have ever got. Skeching, the art is way older than we think. It helped humanity. To me Skeching is more than just an art. It was an escape but now it has become an Hobby.</p>

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>I have been always fasinated by the art of Photogrpahy, were one could store so much in just a single click. And save it for life long. Street Photogrpahy has been one of my favorite genres of Photogrpahy; since in this genre, I don't have to plan anything: It's just "Me and freestyle photogrpahy".</p>
